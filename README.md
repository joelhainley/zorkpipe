# zork pipe

I thought it would be fun/nostalgic to put various strings from a game of zork at the end of a directory listing, or other commands. The most pragmatic approach seemed to me to support piping through a utility that would handle putting the "zorkish bits" at the end of a stream. Hence. `zorkpipe`

In the first iteration, I've simply put the room descriptions in place, though I thought at some point it might be fun to put some of villains, artifact, and weapon descriptions in as well. Randomly throwing things in.

There's not much value to this, just a bit of a saturday morning goof.

I've been pulling the strings from this repo: https://github.com/historicalsource/zork1
